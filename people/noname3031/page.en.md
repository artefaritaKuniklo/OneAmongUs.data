## Description

noah is a mysterious trans girl. Although her Twitter persona seems boring, she is a lovely person.
Her death was confirmed by [Han Lian Yi](https://twitter.com/HANLIANYI520/status/1613697897203367938).
She left [a note](https://noname3031.one/article/rip_noah/index.html) and [bid farewell to](https://noname3031.one/article/rip_ani/index.html) [another trans girl](https://one-among.us/profile/Anilovr) in her blog ([archived on Wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20230121030916/https://noname3031.one/)) before committing suicide.

Here are some postcards she sent to her friends before leaving:

> noah once thought [Mio Card Meow](https://one-among.us/profile/MioCardMeow) is the character base of the cat in my short novel. After that, I formed a bond with Mio Card Meow.
> She sent me postcards three days ago; she cracked jokes with me two days ago; she was chatting with me one day ago. I was shocked when I heard the news today.
> I received your postcard. I will hold onto it to the very end.
> Meet you on Betelgeuse.
